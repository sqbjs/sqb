## About SQB

SQB is an extensible, multi-dialect SQL query builder and Database connection wrapper for NodeJS.

## About @sqb/builder

`@sqb/builder` is the query construction and serialization core the whole SQB stack is built on.
It lets you compose `Select`, `Insert`, `Update` and `Delete` statements as plain JavaScript/
TypeScript objects — with type-checked columns, joins, conditions and parameters — and turns them
into the correct SQL text for whichever database you're targeting, without depending on any driver
or network connection itself.

Serialization is dialect-driven: each target database (Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL
Server, SQLite, ...) is a pluggable `SerializerExtension` that can override how any part of a query
is rendered — identifier quoting, `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` syntax, boolean literals, `RETURNING` support,
and more — while everything it doesn't override falls through to sensible defaults. This is what
lets [`@sqb/connect`](../connect) and the various dialect/adapter packages share one query-building
API across every supported database.

```ts
import { Select, Eq } from '@sqb/builder';

const query = Select('id', 'given_name', 'family_name')
  .from('customers')
  .where(Eq('active', true))
  .orderBy('id')
  .limit(10);

const { sql, params } = query.generate({ dialect: 'postgres' });
```

## Main goals

- Single code base for any sql based database
- Powerful and simplified query coding scheme
- Fast applications with low memory requirements
- Let applications work with large data tables efficiently
- Support latest JavaScript language standards
- Lightweight and extensible framework.
