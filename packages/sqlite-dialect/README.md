## About SQB

SQB is an extensible, multi-dialect SQL query builder and Database connection wrapper for NodeJS.

## About @sqb/sqlite-dialect

This package registers the `sqlite` SQL serialization dialect (a `SerializerExtension` for
[`@sqb/builder`](../builder)) shared by both [`@sqb/sqlite`](../sqlite) (native `node:sqlite` /
`bun:sqlite` bindings) and [`@sqb/sqljs`](../sqljs) (the `sql.js` WASM build). It is loaded
automatically when either adapter is imported, so you normally don't need to depend on it directly.

It applies SQLite's `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` syntax and reserved-word list. `RETURNING` is stripped from
the generated SQL; both adapters emulate it with a follow-up `SELECT` keyed on SQLite's implicit
`rowid`, rather than relying on `RETURNING` support that may not be present in every SQLite build.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @sqb/sqlite-dialect --save
```

## Node Compatibility

- node >= 20.x
