## About SQB

SQB is an extensible, multi-dialect SQL query builder and Database connection wrapper for NodeJS.

## About @sqb/connect

`@sqb/connect` is the driver-agnostic connection and ORM layer built on top of
[`@sqb/builder`](../builder). It provides:

- **`SqbClient`** — manages a connection pool for a given `Adapter` (the actual database driver
  package, e.g. [`@sqb/postgres`](../postgres) or [`@sqb/mysql`](../mysql)), and runs queries or
  callbacks against acquired connections.
- **`SqbConnection`** — wraps a single live connection: executes generated queries, streams or
  fetches cursors, and manages transactions (`startTransaction`/`commit`/`rollback`, with
  savepoint support where the adapter allows it).
- **`Repository` / `@Entity`** — a full-featured ORM on top of the client: decorate a class with
  `@Entity`, `@Column`, `@PrimaryKey`, `@ForeignKey` and `@Link`, then use `find`, `findOne`,
  `create`, `update`, `delete` and their `*Many` counterparts, including eager-loaded associations
  and embedded objects.
- **`Adapter`** — the interface each driver package implements, so a new database only needs a
  connection/cursor implementation and a dialect (`SerializerExtension` from `@sqb/builder`) to
  plug into the rest of the stack.

```ts
import '@sqb/postgres';
import { SqbClient } from '@sqb/connect';

const client = new SqbClient({
  dialect: 'postgres',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'mydb',
});

const result = await client.execute('select * from customers where id = $1', {
  params: [1],
});
```

## Main goals

- Single code base for any sql based database
- Powerful and simplified query coding scheme
- Fast applications with low memory requirements
- Let applications work with large data tables efficiently
- Support latest JavaScript language standards
- Lightweight and extensible framework.
